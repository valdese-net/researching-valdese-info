Here is a content dump of minuted items related to this project:

## March 16, 2015: Annual Council/Department Head Budget Retreat

- [link](https://static.townofvaldese.com/public/media/uploads/2015_combined_meeting_minutes.pdf#page=17)

FIRE Charlie Watts said the department had 35 air bottles that would reach end-of-life age per DOT and would need
to be replaced at $800 each at an estimated cost of $28,000. Upgrade 45 bottles and upgrades to current air packs to
4500psi - $40,000; upgrade to filling station - $1,000. He reviewed advantages or disadvantages of the bottles and air
packs. He said 18 new air packs with spare bottles, firefighter tracker system and improved firefighter communication
system would cost an estimated $125,000. The department currently has a 1985 Pierce Arrow 50’ Ladder Truck (30
years old) and repair parts were non-existent and there were a lot of issues with the ladder truck. The estimate to
refurbish the current ladder truck - $300,000. He estimated a cost of $750,000 for a new ladder truck with a 75 foot
ladder. They need a new phone system for departments, new apparatus engine bay heaters, want to participate in
elementary school reading program and they need additional volunteer firefighting personnel. The metal roof and trim
needs painting at a cost of $6,500.

Chief Watts said staff needed to obtain the deed from The Settings by June 30, 2015.

Mr. Morse said there would be an additional $20,000 contribution for the new communications center

## July 1, 2015: Mr. Seth Eckard Appointed Town Manager

Mr. Seth Eckard appointed as new Valdese Town Manager, replacing Mr. Jeff Morse.

## March 22, 2016: Annual Council/Department Head Budget Retreat

- [link](https://static.townofvaldese.com/public/media/uploads/2016_combined.pdf#page=21)

FIRE Charlie Watts said the department currently has a 1985 Pierce Arrow 50’ Ladder Truck and repair parts were
non-existent and had to be custom-made. He estimated a cost of $780,000-$850,000 for a new ladder truck with a 75
foot ladder. In order to maintain the current NC Department of Insurance Rated Fire Department with a Class 4 Rating
they must have no less than 20 personnel listed on the state roster and he currently has 21 firefighters with seven fulltime and 14 paid on-call. The contributing factors for no volunteers is the aging population, median age of Valdese
residents is 46.9; rise in two-income households; training and response requirements; less flexible employers; family
and home responsibilities, and career/job demands. He recommended hiring part-time personnel to meet the NC
State roster requirement of 20 which would put more personnel on incident scenes and provide personnel to assist
with ongoing programs at a cost estimate of $25,000 for a part-time Firefighter/EMT, eight hours per day, five days per
week. He recommended resurfacing of parking lot and front pad at an estimated cost of $40,000; fire apparatus
engine bay heaters - $7,500. He said the estimated cost to renovate the old town hall would be approximately
$130,000.

## August 1, 2016: Town Council Meeting

Mr. Eckard said the loan agreement with USDA for the Ladder Truck was in the amount of $850,000. Fortunately, the
USDA provided a grant in the amount of $46,700. The terms for the USDA loan would be $803,300 loan at
2.5 percent interest rate for 20 years with an annual debt payment of $52,761.

FIRE DEPARTMENT CHARLIE WATTS – DEPARTMENTAL REQUESTS AND 911 COMMUNICATION CENTER
Chief Watts said the new fire engine should arrive in October 2017. He offered a brief update on the 911
Communication Center. He said the Police and Fire Departments would need a new complex within the next 10 years.
He said the Fire Department needed bay door replacement and resurfacing of the front pad and as a future budget
item they would need a Rescue UTV

## June 5, 2017: Town Council Meeting

## March 19, 2018: Annual Budget Retreat, Old Rock School, Waldensian Room

- [link](https://www.townofvaldese.com/media/uploads/2018_minutes.pdf)

Chief Watts informed Council that he received a report from an engineer today about possible structural issues at the fire and police complex. Staff will meet with the engineer to discuss the findings.

## June 4, 2018: Town Council Meeting

- [link](https://static.townofvaldese.com/public/media/uploads/2018_combined_minutes.pdf#page=32)

PUBLIC SAFETY BUILDING Fire Chief Charlie Watts informed Council that staff has been monitoring the structural
faults in the public safety building for a number of years with no marginal change in those characteristics. Chief Watts
stated that the extreme cold the area experienced in January created two additional cracks in the floor that weren’t
there previously and also worsened the cracks in the walls that had existed prior to that time. Chief Watts stated that
these changes brought the structural integrity of the building into question. Chief Watts met with representatives of
West & Associates and was advised that review by a structural engineer was recommended because what was in
the building was beyond their expertise. Chief Watts then contacted C. Michael Alberto, III and requested an
inspection of the facility. Mr. Alberto conducted a forensic inspection of the building and made recommendations
based on his findings. Chief Watts shared that this report had been distributed to Council for their review and that a
copy of the report can be found on the Town’s website. Chief Watts highlighted the findings in Mr. Alberto’s report.

Town Manager Seth Eckard stated that the building is not in any immediate danger of collapse. Mr. Alberto stated
that isolated damage could occur if there were an extreme event such as a tornado. Chief Watts indicated that minimal
repairs; such as, putting braces up on the outside of the building every so often and bracing the wall will be made to
buy some time over the next couple of years to allow the Town to create an action plan. Mr. Eckard stated that the
Town is currently considering three options: renovate the current structure, usefulness of the BB&T building, and
building a new facility. Mr. Eckard stated that the assistance of professionals is important during this process to
ensure the best investment for Valdese. Mr. Eckard stated that long term solutions will be studied closely and
presented to Council during next year’s budget process.

Chief Watts introduced Ken Newell of SCN Architects, sharing that he selected this firm as they specialize in fire and
police departments. Mr. Newell highlighted his proposal and stated that he will not duplicate the work that Mr. Alberto
has already completed. Mr. Newell will develop a written program for every interior and exterior space associated
with both departments, evaluate long term and short term needs of the departments, study the BB&T facility to
determine if one or both departments would fit, and study the existing public safety building. SCN Architects will
review the report created by Mr. Alberto and give recommendations on the existing building to determine if its use as
a public safety building should be continued. SCN will also provide preliminary design options including rough
estimate construction cost projections for the aforementioned buildings.

Mayor Black asked Mr. Newell if his position as an architect would influence the decision to renovate or build new
and asked if entering into this contract for design services and feasibility study would bind the Town to further contract
with SCN Architects. Mr. Newell stated that his firm provides various services across North Carolina and that many
times it makes more sense to renovate and/or add to existing facilities than to build new. Mr. Newell stated that the
Town has no obligation to contract with his firm after the study is complete; however, one benefit of using SCN for
this process is that credit would be applied to future invoices for work already performed if the Town did decide to
further contract with SCN.

Councilman Ogle asked if there was a way to explore options without entering into a contract. Town Manager Seth
Eckard stated that staff did not have the expertise to make the necessary determinations and recommendations.

Councilman Delp stated that he didn’t think Council should be asked to make an informed decision without being
informed of the available options and what it may cost. Mr. Delp felt it was important to have someone that knows
what they are talking about to assist with this process.

Councilwoman Stevenson said she felt it was important to have the proper information so we do not end up with this
problem again. This will help us make the right decision.

Councilman Sweezy made a motion to enter into a contract with Stewart Cooper Newall Architects for design services
and a feasibility study in the amount of $17,500, and to authorize the town manager to sign the contract, seconded
by Councilwoman Stevenson. The motion passed with voting as follows: Stevenson-aye, Delp-aye, Sweezy-aye.
Opposed: Councilman Ogle.

## August 2, 2018: Town Council Special Meeting

- [link](https://static.townofvaldese.com/public/media/uploads/2018_combined_minutes.pdf#page=48)

Mayor Black called the meeting to order at 7:00 p.m. Mr. Black stated that this was a Special Called Council Meeting to
meet with representatives from SCN-Architects to discuss the results of the police and fire department feasibility study
and to discuss the structural engineer’s findings. Mr. Black informed the audience that no public comments would be
taken at this meeting.

STRUCTURAL ENGINEER REPORT: Structural Engineer Michael Alberto presented the findings of the forensic
inspection of the public safety building. Mr. Alberto shared that he focused his study on the location that is currently
occupied, this is the area with the most severe issues and where operations take place. Mr. Alberto shared that the
damage to the existing building compromises both gravity load and lateral load capacity, which is causing the structural
issues. Mr. Alberto presented Council with three options: temporary shoring, Option A, and Option B. The estimated cost
of temporary shoring is $150,000 and will provide support for at least ten years, the estimated cost of Option A is
$700,000 and will provide support for at least thirty years, the estimated cost of Option B is $1,268,000 and will provide
support for at least fifty years.

Councilwoman Hildebran asked what the timeline for each option would be. Mr. Alberto shared that there is not a clear
timeline for this project yet as many decisions need to be made before beginning a project of this extent.

PRESENTATION OF FEASIBILITY STUDY: Ken Newell of SCN- Architects informed Council that everything that Mr.
Alberto presented is critical for whatever Council decides to do with the building, if they do not tear it down. Mr. Newell
continued to state that everything that has been discussed up until this point has just addressed structural needs,
departmental needs have not been factored in. Mr. Newell shared that the purpose of the feasibility study was to
determine what the departmental needs are today, and what the needs are for the future; sharing the specific needs for
each department. Based on these needs, Mr. Newell presented various options and cost estimates for the departments.

Representatives from SCN-Architects shared that the timeline to start a new construction is almost two years and
encouraged Council to approve the temporary shoring repairs to ensure the safety of staff if they wished to proceed with
a construction option.

COUNCIL DISCUSSION AND QUESTIONS: Councilwoman Stevenson asked Police Chief Jack Moss and Fire Chief
Charlie Watts if they felt it was important for the departments to remain at the same location; they responded that it is
not important. Chief Watts shared that it is important for the fire department to remain in a location close to the center of
town for response times and insurance rates.

Mayor Black asked the representatives from SCN-Architects if they would be available to answer questions at a later
date, should Council request additional information. The representatives indicated that they are available at any time.
Mayor Black mentioned that the Town of Maiden just built a new fire station and expressed his interest in knowing how
much they paid for it.

Councilwoman Hildebran expressed her appreciation for having all of the options available for Council to consider to
assist with making the best and most informed decision.

## August 6, 2018: Town Council Regular Meeting

- [link](https://static.townofvaldese.com/public/media/uploads/2018_combined_minutes.pdf#page=55)

PUBLIC SAFETY BUILDING DISCUSSION During the presentation of the feasibility study conducted by SCNArchitects, Council was informed that the BB&T building would not be suitable for the police or fire departments.
Councilwoman Hildebran made a motion to cancel the offer to purchase the BB&T bank building, seconded by
Councilman Sweezy. The vote was unanimous.

Town Manager Seth Eckard will contact representatives with BB&T to inform them of Council’s decision regarding the
property located at 225 Main Street E, Valdese.

Fire Chief Charlie Watts requested permission to proceed with short-term repairs to the public safety building. Mr. Watts
informed Council that the structural engineer and architect are prepared to answer any questions they may have. The
cost for temporary repairs is $149,500. Mr. Watts shared that this cost could increase if additional issues arise during
the repairs.

Councilwoman Stevenson expressed her concern with spending this amount of money for a temporary fix and felt that
the funds would be better utilized if applied to something that could remain if Council decided to stay in the current facility.
Ms. Stevenson stated, “if we are going to do something major, I would not want to put that much money into something
that is temporary. If we decide to repair and renovate the current structure, we could already have that much money
towards that project and not have to start all over.”

Councilman Sweezy stated, “if we go with something like Option A we would have a building that should stand up for
another 30 years and that would allow enough time to develop a better solution perhaps build a new structure at a time
that we can come up with the funds to do so. Option A would not waste this temporary shoring money, it would give us
an opportunity to perhaps investigate alternatives to Option A down the road.”

Mr. Alberto shared that Option A would be a long-term fix, that with proper maintenance, could be effective for at least
30, and up to 50, years.

Town Manager Seth Eckard shared that if Council were to decide to select Option A, in future budget years, Council
could consider other remodeling costs for the interior of the building and also later on look at the cost of possibly
demolishing the unused portion of old town hall and utilizing that better for parking or other needs.

Mayor Black acknowledged that Council had reached a consensus, wishing to pursue Option A and requested to
continue this discussion at the next meeting when staff has more definite numbers and details for this option.

PUBLIC SAFETY BUILDING TEMPORARY REPAIRS Benjamin “Benjie” Thomas of West Consultants,
PLLC, recommended that temporary structural supports be installed at the Public Safety Building. Mr.
Thomas shared that Structural Engineer C. Michael Alberto will have a final design for the supports by May
31, 2019; at which time West Consultants can assist with preparing bidding documents. Mr. Thomas hopes
to receive bids in time for presentation at the June 24, 2019 or August 5, 2019 council meeting. Mr. Thomas

Public Safety Building
The Town is in the process of selecting an architect to design a new public safety building that
will replace the old deteriorating facility. Now is an optimal time to design and construct a new
facility, given the historically low long-term financing rates and competitive bidding by local
contractors. This project may take up to four years to complete.

## January 4, 2021: Town Council Regular Meeting

- [link](https://www.townofvaldese.com/media/uploads/2021_minutes_combined.pdf#page=7)

CONTINUATION OF THE JANUARY 4, 2021 COUNCIL MEETING: At 10:00 a.m. Mayor Black
reconvened the January 4, 2021, Council Meeting to discuss the new Public Safety building. Town
Manager Seth Eckard introduced the reason for the meeting to discuss the comparison of two potential
sites for the building. Marty Beal, Architect, with CBSA Architects, RJ Mozeley, Project Manager, Doug
Chapman, Principle/Office Manager, Matt Oetting, Project Manager, with McGill presented the following
presentation

RJ Mozeley started the presentation with an overview of what would be presented. Mr. Mozeley shared
that we want to make sure that the site chosen is accessible and functional to meet the needs of the Fire
and Police departments operations and be cost-effective. Mr. Mozeley shared that the cost we are talking
about today are estimates in comparing just the two sites, it does not include the details, and the cost
numbers will change some.

Marty Beal explained that on the Rostan property, we are looking at two options, with one being a 1-story
building and one a 2-story building. Mr. Beal shared that the 1-story building is the most efficient use of
space, and both Police and Fire Chiefs feel they would be better served with the 1-story.

Matt Oetting shared that the Rostan property is on 2.3 acres located at the intersection of Main St. and
Eldred St., with Martinat Dr. adjoining it. This location is highly visible. It does have a level pad in the
middle but has steep slopes on the left and right sides. Mr. Oetting showed the 1-story layout of the
Rostan site. Both sites will include secured parking for the Police Department. Mr. Oetting shared to
provide access to the facility, Martinat Dr. would have to be re-paved. The flat pad area is not large
enough to accommodate all the uses needed, so to create a larger space, several retaining walls would
have to be placed around the site. Mr. Oetting explained that there is no room to address stormwater
drainage due to the parking lots needed, so it would have to be addressed underground. Typically it
would be addressed aboveground, which would be a lower cost. Councilman Thompson asked if the
Pascal property on Eldred St. could be purchased to use that space and Town Manager Seth Eckard said
the owner was not interested in selling it. Councilman Ogle asked if a fire truck would fit on Eldred St.
Mr. Beal shared that that is one of the problems with this property. Eldred St. will not allow a fire truck to
go up the street to access Laurel St. efficiently, so the route would be traveling West on Main St. to turn
onto Laurel St. Mr. Oetting explained that the Town would have to look at completing road improvements
at Martinat Dr. and Main St. as well as adding a right turn lane at the intersection of Main St. and Laurel
St. for the fire truck to make a right turn onto Laurel St. Mr. Eckard noted that in order to make these road
changes, the money would have to come out of the Fund Balance.

Mr. Oetting explained that on the 2-story, the Fire Department would be on the lower level and not have
drive-thru bays. The Police Department would be on the upper level. Mr. Beal shared a few pros and cons
on the 2-story site. There will be added cost with having to add an elevator, two stairs, and structure cost.
Mr. Beal said that there would be a decrease in less retaining walls and no underground stormwater drain.

Mr. Oetting moved to the next site option, located next to the Pineburr Mill, consisting of 18.4 acres, a
43,000 square foot mill facility, an electrical substation, an 8,500 square foot garage, and a 2,000 square
foot storage building. The site’s focus area is the 3 acres next to the mill facility where the building would
be located. Mr. Oetting shared that this site is less visible. A 1-story building was only considered for this
site with a combined public parking area and a separate secure police parking lot, and two entrances for
the fire department vehicles. Mr. Oetting shared that the stormwater basin would be located above ground.
The garage/shop facility could be used by other departments with possible removal of the other facilities
located in the property. Councilwoman Stevenson asked if the fire bays were drive-thru. Mr. Beal answered
that, yes, they were drive-thru bays, but with the amount and kinds of vehicles the Fire Department has,
some of the bays would not be used as a drive-thru. Chief Stafford shared that neither site would allow for
complete drive-thru bays. Councilman Ogle added that there is more property located on the parcel that is
a wooded area. Mr. Mozeley shared that the wooded area does have steep terrains and would be difficult
to develop. Councilman Sweezy asked if we could demo the Pineburr Mill to use that area for extra space.
Mr. Eckard stated that purchasing this property comes with the Mill and outbuildings, and it would cost too
much to demolish the building. Councilman Thompson asked how long the Mill had sat vacant and
wondered if it was worth anything. Mr. Eckard shared that some of the building is being leased to business
owners as storage. Public Services Director Greg Padgett explained that the Mill would be hard for Public
Works to use as storage due to the layout and would take approximately $50,000 minimal to clean out the
basement. There would be a cost to maintaining the building going forward. Mr. Padgett believes it is not
a good use for Town departments and suggests tearing it down. Councilman Ogle wondered if it would be
a future site for a new Public Works building if it was torn down. Mr. Eckard said that could be an option at
some point. Planning Director Larry Johnson shared that a developer looked at the facility, and his thoughts
were it would take a significant amount of work. The developer has suggested completing a market study
and assisting a developer with tax credits or using a type of incentive for development.

Mr. Mozeley went over some of the pros; no retaining walls or underground stormwater needed. Since it
would be on one level, it would have easier accommodations for common public access and the
adminatrative assistant would be located between both departments. However, the con would be the
adjacent vacant buildings that come with the purchase of the property. Mr. Eckard did not recommend
demolition of the building, which would cost around $450,000. This cost would come out of the Fund
Balance. Mr. Eckard shared that the State does not have grant funds to demo the building at this time, but
we would try again in the future if we go with this property.

Councilwoman Hildebran shared that although she does not care for either site, the Pineburr site seems to
be the best option. Councilwoman Hildebran asked to hear from the Police Chief and Fire Chief on how
they feel about the sites. Fire Chief Stafford stated that our Town is limited with available parcels, and his
priority is on the operation side first and visibility aspect second. Chief Stafford is in favor of the Pineburr
site because it is more conducive to our operational needs. Councilman Sweezy would love for the building
to be displayed on Main St. but feels that the Pineburr option is logistically the best. Councilman Ogle
asked if staff has looked at all other properties in Town that could be used. Chief Stafford shared that they
looked at the property behind the Rock Drug Store in October 2020, and two brothers own it and are not
willing to sell for various reasons. Mr. Johnson stated that the ideal size for the new public safety building
would be built on at least 4 acres, centrally located, which limits the number of parcels that would be
available for development. Councilwoman Hildebran has a concern with there being another vacant
building once Public Safety moves out. Councilwoman Hildebran asked again why we cannot close the
street at the current Public Safety building and build onto what we currently have. Mr. Eckard does not feel
like that option is feasible. Mr. Mozeley does not feel like these parcels sit on enough acres and would
have to go with a 2-story building, would have stormwater challenges, and would be a tougher site to build
on. Mr. Beal added that there are more boundary restrictions being in the downtown area. Councilman
Ogle feels that we need to move forward with the Pineburr building site.

Mr. Eckard stated that he would like Council to agree on which location they recommended and if it was
the Pineburr site to move into Closed Session to discuss the negotiation price for purchase of the property.

CLOSED SESSION: Mayor Black called for a motion to recess into Closed Session pursuant to NC General
Statute 143-318.11 (a) (5) to establish, or instruct the public body’s staff or negotiating agents concerning
the position to be taken by or on behalf of the public body in negotiating the price and other material terms
of a contract or proposed contract for the acquisition of real property by purchase, option, exchange, or
lease.

At 11:35 a.m., Councilman Sweezy made a motion to move into Closed Session pursuant to NC General
Statute 143-318.11 (a) (5) to establish, or instruct the public body’s staff or negotiating agents concerning
the position to be taken by or on behalf of the public body in negotiating the price and other material terms
of a contract or proposed contract for the acquisition of real property by purchase, option, exchange, or
lease. The motion was seconded by Councilman Ogle. The vote was unanimous.

At 11:48 a.m., Councilman Ogle made a motion to return to Open Session, seconded by Councilman
Sweezy. The vote was unanimous.

NEGOTIATION DISCUSSION OF THE PINEBURR MILL SITE: Councilman Ogle made a motion to give
the Town Manager the approval to negotiate the purchase price of the Pineburr Property for $98,132,
seconded by Councilman Sweezy. The vote was unanimous.

## October 2021: Town Manager Seth Eckard's Letter to Citizens

- [link](https://www.townofvaldese.com/media/uploads/october_2021.docx)

(October 2021) Greetings Valdese Citizens,
Valdese Town Council wishes to share with Valdese citizens the research that is being conducted as a result of structural deterioration at the Public Safety building on Faet Street. A comprehensive timeline has been created outlining a series of studies and professional opinions on the current Public Safety Building. In recent years, the structural integrity of the building has become compromised in many areas with cracking throughout interior and exterior walls of the building. The attached document includes a comprehensive timeline with structural reports, architectural studies, programming and email correspondence all of which explain the issues surrounding the building’s failing structure and options for the future.

Since 2018, Town Council members and staff have consulted with civil engineers, structural engineers and architects to gather professional opinions detailing the possibilities of repairing the current facility or constructing a new public safety building, and the logistics of each. This information has been gathered in preparation for the Valdese Town Council members who will be sworn in at the December 6th, 2021 Town Council Meeting.

It is important to note; Valdese Town Council has not made a final decision to go forward with construction of a new facility.  Information is circulating about possible service and program funding cuts in order to financially support the debt service payments of a new building. There are no plans nor need to cut services or program funding.

A public input meeting will be held in early 2022 at the Old Rock School Auditorium. At this meeting, staff will present options for consideration and answer questions related to the future of the Public Safety Building. Citizens are encouraged to contact myself or the Valdese Fire Chief, Greg Stafford or Police Chief, Jack Moss with any questions regarding this study or packet of information. Further information will be shared on the town website at townofavaldese.com.

Sincerely,
Seth Eckard
Valdese Town Manager

## $25,500 Contract Approved with CBSA, for architectural, structural, and civil engineering assessments of the existing Safety Building facility

- [link](https://www.townofvaldese.com/media/uploads/2021_minutes_combined.pdf#page=146)

Safety Building facility to bring it up to industry standards and building codes. The scope of work would

PUBLIC SAFETY BUILDING: Councilwoman Hildebran made a motion to authorize the architect to
develop construction documents for a new facility per USDA guidelines, advertise for the construction bids
and for staff to develop alternative bids that will reduce the size and cost of the proposed facility, seconded
by Councilwoman Lowman.

Councilman Paul Mears asked staff what the process would be to surplus the Pineburr Mill and Property.
Town Manager Seth Eckard shared the process. Councilman Mears visited the Public Safety Building and
felt that if he were a prospective employee, he would not take a job working in that facility. Councilman
Mears has put a lot of time and effort into studying this project and asked if we did repair the building if
there would be a guarantee from the contractor. Architect Marty Beal explained that the standard warranty
would be one year from completion however; you can purchase extended warranties.

Finance Director Bo Weichel was asked about the timeline of this project. Mr. Weichel explained once we
get a vote from Council, we would go through the USDA process, which could take a year. Mr. Beal shared
that it would take three–five months to finish the architect process. Mr. Beal feels that it could take up to
18 months to build a new facility and renovation work could be longer. Councilman Mears asked Mr. Beal
if it would be wise to wait three–four months due to inflation. Mr. Beal does not have the answer, but in his
experience, it would be difficult to build cheaper than what we are at currently. Councilman Thompson
shared that he has had many people reach out to him, and they do not want new construction and do not
understand why we need a facility this large. Councilwoman Hildebran explained that her motion stated
the Council could look at alternate bids. Councilwoman Hildebran noted that we had told our citizens there
would be no tax increase or a reduction in services. Councilman Ogle shared that we have looked at other
areas like the Wells Fargo Building, which cost too much. Councilman Mears want the citizens to know
that the Council has studied this for months. There was a brief discussion about the possibility of a building
a metal building.

RJ Mozeley with McGill Associates explained to Council how the USDA process works. After a brief
discussion, Councilwoman made her motion again.

Councilwoman Hildebran made a motion to authorize the architect to develop construction documents for
a new facility per USDA guidelines, advertise for the construction bids and for staff to develop alternative
bids that will reduce the size and cost of the proposed facility, seconded by Councilwoman Lowman.

PUBLIC HEARING FOR RE-ZONING OF TOWN-OWNED PROPERTY ON PINEBURR AVE. Mayor
Watts re-opened the Public Hearing that was recessed at the May 2, 2022, Council meeting at 6:11 p.m.

Planning Director Larry Johnson presented a re-zoning for town-owned property on Pineburr Ave., the
Valdese Town Council zoning map amendment consistency/inconsistency statement, and the Valdese
Town Council zoning map amendment reasonableness statement. Mr. Johnson requested that Council rezone the current M-1 Manufacturing, R-12 Residential, and R-8 Residential to B-2 General Business. Mr.
Johnson explained that this would allow for government buildings and residential uses.

Planning Director Larry Johnson presented the following presentation:

Property Location: 408 – 800 Pineburr Avenue SE

Parcel ID Numbers: 2743038327, 2743037173, 2743137307, 2743135181

Requested Action: Rezone properties from current designations of M-1 Manufacturing, R-12
Residential, and R-8 Residential to B-2 General Business District

BACKGROUND: The Town of Valdese purchased and received donated property along Pineburr
Avenue SE. The property is under consideration for the location of a new public safety building. The current
zoning designations of M-1 Manufacturing, R-12 Residential, and R-8 Residential restrict the use of the
properties for government buildings over 5,000 square feet or do not list "government building" as a
permitted use. As the probable site, Staff recommended a zoning designation of B-2 General Business.
Government buildings are allowed in the B-2 General Business District without size restrictions.

REVIEW:
Staff finds Rezoning Petition 2-3-22 inconsistent with the Valdese Vision: A Land Use Action Plan for the
Future. In so finding, Staff provides the following review:

1. The Town of Valdese requested a zoning map amendment in March 2022 to rezone four parcels
with zoning designations of M-1 Manufacturing, R-12 Residential, and R-8 Residential to B-2
General Business District.

2. Three of four parcels are vacant or undeveloped. The fourth contains the primary and accessory
structures.

3. The four parcels are contiguous with residential uses, utility easement, and rail tracks. The
proposed Rezoning to B-2 General Business permits "government building" without size
restrictions.

4. The rezoning petition is consistence with one of four parcels identified in The Valdese Vision: Land
Use Action Plan. The Land Use Action Plan identifies Parcel #4, the parking lot, for commercial
development, which will be consistent with the proposed B-2 General Business designation.

5. Staff confirmed the following steps were taken in advance of the public hearing on Rezoning
Petition 2-3-22:

    a. adjoining property owners received first-class mail notifications.

    b. The Town Clerk advertised the public hearing in the local paper.

    c. Staff placed Rezoning Public Hearing signs along with the properties.

PLANNING BOARD ACTION:
The Planning Board took up the issue of the Town's request to amend the Town's Zoning Map around the
parcels described by Parcel ID Numbers: 2743038327, 2743037173, 2743137307, 2743135181 from their
currently designated zoning to Zone B-2 General Business District. The Land Use Plan calls for industrial
and residential uses on three parcels of interest.

The Planning Board found Rezoning Petition 2-3-22 map amendment request to be inconsistent with the
Town of Valdese 2014 Valdese Vision: A Land Use Action Plan. However, in a five to zero vote, the Planning
Board recommends that Town Council amend the Town's zoning map regarding the parcels of interest from
M-1 Manufacturing, R-8 Residential, and R-12 Residential to B-2 General Business District. The Planning
Board consistency/inconsistency stated is included with this memorandum.

TOWN COUNCIL ACTION:
Before taking such lawful action as it may deem advisable, the Town Council shall consider the Planning
Board's recommendations. In turn, Town Council must adopt a written statement (Consistency Statement)
documenting its consideration of the land-use plan when making rezoning map amendment decisions.
Town Council does not have to take actions consistent with The Valdese Vision: A Land Use Action Plan.

Additionally, when adopting or rejecting any petition for a zoning map amendment, a statement analyzing
the reasonableness of the proposed Rezoning shall be approved by the Town Council. This statement of
reasonableness may consider, among other factors, (i) the size, physical conditions, and other attributes of
the area proposed to be rezoned, (ii) the benefits and detriments to the landowners, the neighbors, and the
surrounding community, (iii) the relationship between the current actual and permissible development on
the tract and adjoining areas and the development that would be permissible under the proposed
amendment; (iv) why the action taken is in the public interest; and (v) any changed conditions warranting
the amendment.

VALDESE TOWN COUNCIL
ZONING MAP AMENDMENT
CONSISTENCY/INCONSISTENCY STATEMENT
On June 6, 2022, the Valdese Town Council met to consider Rezoning Petition 2-3-22 and received a
recommendation from the Valdese Planning Board. Upon consideration, the Valdese Town Council finds:

1. The Town of Valdese Planning Board has considered rezoning the following parcels from their
currently designated zoning (as set forth below) to B-2 General Business District.
  a) A 3.70 parcel commonly known as 408 Pineburr Avenue SE, Valdese, NC, Parcel ID Number
  2743038327, Zoned M-1 Manufacturing and R-12 Residential;
  b) A 13.80-acre parcel commonly known as 650 Pineburr Avenue SE, Valdese, NC, Parcel ID
  Number 2743137307, Zoned M-1 Manufacturing and R-8 Residential;
  c) A 0.50-acre parcel commonly known as 800 Pineburr Avenue SE, Valdese, NC, Parcel ID
  Number 2743135181, Zoned R-8 Residential; and
  d) A 0.40-acre parcel commonly known as 409 Pineburr Avenue SE, Valdese, NC, Parcel ID
  Number 2743037173, Zoned R-8 Residential.

2. Found the request to amend the Town's Zoning Map around the parcels described above from their
currently designated zoning to Zone B-2 General Business District to be inconsistent with the
adopted Town of Valdese 2014, The Valdese Vision: A Land Use Action Plan.

3. The Land Use Plan calls for Manufacturing and Residential uses on three parcels of interest.
Valdese's B-2 General Business District does not allow manufacturing uses.

4. The B-2 General Business District permits government buildings and residential development,
including single-family, multi-family, and Planned Unit Development Residential.

5. The four parcels are contiguous with residential uses and manufacturing uses.

6. The Planning Board voted five to zero to recommend that Town Council amend the Town's zoning
    map regarding the parcels from M-1 Manufacturing, R-8 Residential, and R-12 Residential to B-2
    General Business District.

    Based upon the recommendation of the Valdese Planning Board and the findings from the public hearing,
    the Valdese Town Council, having found Rezoning Petition 2-3-22 to be inconsistent with the Valdese
    Vision: A Land Use Action Plan for the Future, approves Rezoning Petition 2-3-22 and the recommendation
    from the Valdese Planning Board to amend the Town's zoning map regarding the parcels of interest from
    M-1 Manufacturing, R-8 Residential and R-12 Residential to B-2 General Business District.

    VALDESE TOWN COUNCIL

    Zoning Map Amendment Reasonableness Statement
    On June 6, 2022, the Valdese Town Council met to consider Rezoning Petition 2-3-22 and found the
    proposed zoning amendment is reasonable and in the public interest because:

7. The total acreage of the four parcels subject to Rezoning Petition 2-3-22 (18.4 acres) is of sufficient
size so as not to be construed as “spot” zoning.

8. The surrounding zoning designations are R-8 Residential, R-12 Residential, and M-1
Manufacturing. The surrounding land uses include residential development and manufacturing.

9. As zoned (M-1 Manufacturing), a portion of the subject properties could be developed for industrial
and related uses, which could include, by way of example and not limited to, an automotive body
repair shop, automotive repair, automotive service station, recycling center, a collection point or
plant, manufacturing, truck terminal, and warehousing. In addition, with a Special Use Permit, a
portion of the subject properties could be developed and used as, by way of example and with no
limitation, a flea market, landfill, lumberyard, mixing plant for concrete or paving materials, stone
crushing, cutting and polishing, and tobacco processing and storage. The B-2 General Business
District permits residential development, including single-family, multi-family, and Planned Unit
Development Residential. Some of the above M-1 Manufacturing uses could be more detrimental
to the surrounding residential development than the permitted uses in a B-2 General Business
District and the intended use of the subject properties for the construction and operation of a public
safety building.

10. B-2 General Business development will not harm the surrounding land uses in that, among other
things, it will remain subject to the site plan ordinance governing development criteria.

11. The zoning amendment will allow the construction of a government building to benefit the Town
and surrounding landowners and enable non-industrial development in the vacant primary building.

12. The Valdese Vision: A Land Use Action Plan for the Future was adopted in 2014. The Town
subsequently acquired the subject property while exploring locations for constructing and operating
a new public safety building. There are few reasonably available alternate locations in the Town of
Valdese to build and operate a new public safety building, which is needed to protect and serve the
community and hire, retain, and serve the community’s emergency responders. Town Council finds
that conditions have changed since adopting the Valdese Vision: A Land Use Action Plan for the
Future, warranting this zoning amendment.

Based upon those above and the findings from the public hearing, the Valdese Town Council, finds
Rezoning Petition 2-3-22 to be reasonable and approves Rezoning Petition 2-3-22.

APPROVED OFFER TO PURCHASE TOWN OWNED PROPERTY – PINEBURR MILL: Assistant Town
Manager/CFO Bo Weichel shared that the Town received an offer to purchase the Pineburr Mill property
and the parking lot across the street, which is a little over four acres of property. Councilwoman Lowman
asked if the parking lot would not need to be used for the proposed Public Safety Building. Mr. Weichel
said it was not in any of the Public Safety plans.

RESOLUTION AUTHORIZING UPSET BID PROCESS
(Sale of 3.426 Acres at 408 Pineburr Ave SE, Valdese, NC)
(Sale of 0.40 Acres at 409 Pineburr Ave SE, Valdese, NC)

the town has received an offer to purchase the property described above, in the
amount of $30,000.00, submitted by WC Erwin or assigns;

WC Erwin or assigns has paid the required five percent (5%) deposit of his offer.

THIS RESOLUTION IS ADOPTED OCTOBER 3rd, 2022.

Mr. Weichel shared that one modification had been made to the plat that angles the lot lines, allowing fire
trucks to access the Public Safety building off Ribet Ave. Mr. Weichel explained that the Burke County GIS
website does not show that currently, but it will be updated. Mr. Weichel shared that the person that made
the offer is aware of this. Councilwoman Hildebran shared that WC Erwin made the offer, and they have
proposed to develop the property for residential use. Town Manager Seth Eckard reminded Council that
the original Public Safety building project proposal included demolishing the Mill at the cost of $450,000.
Mr. Eckard shared that by deposing this property through the upset bid process, we would save the cost of
demolition and get money for the purchase. In return, hopefully, the property will be turned into muchneeded
market-rate housing. Mr. Weichel shared that this Resolution will allow staff to start the upset bid
process and explained the process. Councilwoman Hildebran asked if this would involve any rezoning or if
we needed to notify any property owners. Mr. Eckard said no.
